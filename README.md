P.S: Before you can run this project, npm needs to be installed. Run npm install from the terminal

The tools used for this project is: React, JavaScript, Cypress.io, Styled-components, react-virtualized, formik, react-responsive, and more

Added to this project is the figma project: https://www.figma.com/file/ece5VdyEtpeiQTBRljO7xO/Propagate-Project

It also has a cypress.io integration, so feel free to test that by writing npm run start and then in a seperate terminal write npm run cypress:open

It has both a mobile and a desktop integration. I always start with mobile first and I spent a little extra effort to design and implement a mobile version.

The table runs with a library called react-virtualized, which is a virtualization library that would make the data run a little faster. In our mockup it doesn't make a difference, but it does when the dataset is larger.

The table also has a mobile mode and a desktop mode, and the mobile mode has swipe integrated.

We use media queries to allow for mobile and desktop modes. We use a library called react-responsive because that allows us to show the different views as components, and I find that easier to work with when it comes to react, as everything else is components.

We use formik for our forms to add new rows to the table, because we want to be easily able to add validation using the yup library


This project is made with Create-react-app. Information on how to run it is underneath:


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
